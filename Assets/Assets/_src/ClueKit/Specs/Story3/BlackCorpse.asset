  Name: Ms Black's dead body
  Description: Ms Black's dead body
  GeneralDisplayText: Oh Lord, Ms Black's dead body! It looks like her face's been
    burned, and the blood! Her thumb has been cut off!
  PrivateClue: 1
  Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 91e8ad053ec0849749b8bffd856c8f37, type: 2}
  PrivateDisplayText: How horrible! Ms Black's dead body! It looks like her face is
    burned, the blood seems to be from her missing thumb. But it looks like the cause
    of death is strangulation by Black's own scarf!

  AltCharacter1: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 66df30185d75646c98ac0f916b23bd44, type: 2}
  AltPrivateDisplayText1: I killed Black by strangling her with her scarf and burning
    her face with the broken steam pipe. I then cut the thumb off for my collection.
    A plum for a thumb.

  AltPrivateDisplayText2: Ah damn, she's dead! That makes it harder to steal her painting
    without it causing more suspicion or danger on us. This is not going according
    to plan.
